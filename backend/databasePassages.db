It is globally square in shape with four consecutive sides 11, 12, 13 and 14 but one of its vertices is missing at its opening in the direction opposite the chamber. The sides 12 and 13 are at the bottom of the cross-section while the sides 11 and 14 correspond to the sides that will be on the outside of the chamber, and in contact with which the chamber closing panels marked 16 and 17 are applied.\n\nThe flange 8 extends along the side 11 extending perpendicular to this side 11 and in the direction opposite the central region of the chamber. Similarly, the flange 9 extends the side 14, and is perpendicular to this side in the direction opposite the central region of the chamber. There is thus a right angle between the two flanges 8 and 9, and they jointly delimit a tapered opening in the section facing outwards.\n\n","annotation":"another note","fileId":1,"startIndex":9,"endIndex":14,"startOffset":321,"endOffset":0,"yPosition":0,"_id":"KcHK1OA4xOMZANTU"}

Clamping of the first joint clamps while maintaining a backing frame tends to move the backing frame and even to make it drop. Furthermore, the operator determines the separation between the joint clamps such that it might be excessively random and vary from one operator to another. Retightening of one joint clamp tends to loosen the adjacent joint clamps and even make them move. Furthermore, the threads in the clamping screws of each joint clamp form portions that can be difficult to decontaminate if there is any contamination on the outside of the box. Finally, the series of joint clamps fitted on a globe box project such that they can get caught in clothes and/or overalls of operators.\n\nThe purpose of this invention is to disclose a solution to overcome these disadvantages.\n\nPRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION","annotation":"here is a note","fileId":1,"startIndex":15,"endIndex":19,"startOffset":578,"endOffset":29,"yPosition":0,"_id":"fYi67jgjr9q0mIOS"}
